### For Development

To set up the development environment and start using these components in your projects, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btims512/storybook-library.git
cd storybook-library
npm install
```

After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, you can start the Storybook server:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start the Storybook server and open it in your default web browser.

### For Production

To use the components from this library in your own project, you can install it as an npm package.

```bash
npm install react-storybook-library-v3
```

After installing, you can import and use the components in your project:

Example: Button

```bash
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-storybook-library-v3';

const ExampleComponent = () => (
  <Button label="Click me" onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')} />
);

export default ExampleComponent;
```

Example: Project Card

```bash
import React from 'react';
import { ProjectCard } from 'react-storybook-library-v3';
import AppleIcon from './assets/project-logo-storybook@2x.png';

const ExampleProjectCard = () => (
  <ProjectCard
    title="Project Title"
    description="Description"
    tech="React, CSS, Storybook"
    codeLink="https://github.com"
